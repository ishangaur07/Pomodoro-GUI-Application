# Pomodoro-GUI-Application

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.
